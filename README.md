# Hangman-Game
Hangman is a word-guessing game usually played by two or more players. One player thinks of a word and the other player(s) try to guess it by suggesting letters within a certain number of attempts. Here's a more detailed description of how the game works:
Setup:
- One player selects a secret word.
- The secret word is typically represented by dashes, with one dash for each letter in the word.
- The number of dashes corresponds to the number of letters in the word, representing the letters that need to be guessed.

Gameplay:
- The guessing player(s) attempt to guess the letters in the secret word.
- For each guess, the player suggests a letter that they believe may be in the secret word.
- If the guessed letter is in the secret word, all occurrences of that letter are revealed in the appropriate positions.
- If the guessed letter is not in the secret word, the player loses one of their allotted attempts, and part of the hangman is drawn (such as a gallows, stick figure, etc.)
- The game continues until the guessing player(s) correctly guess the word or run out of attempts.

Implementing Hangman in C++ involves using data structures such as strings, vectors, loops, and conditional statements to manage the game state, handle user input, and control the flow of the game. The code example provided earlier in this conversation demonstrates a basic implementation of Hangman in C++.
